# stringsearcher
Script that can recursively search through a specified file type for a specific string of text

Updated to work completely on 4/29/2022

Recursion now works as intended
Specified file types now work as intended
File types work irregardless of prepended "." before file type, should the user choose to provide it
OOP implementation to cut down on code re-use
REGEX use to find text in lines rather than checking if the line itself is an exact match
Output improved
Character location for input text beginning and end of appropriate line and file is now shown in output
